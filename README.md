# Heart_Beating_Simple_Project
The heart of this project lies in the ingenious utilization of the 555 timer, a popular integrated circuit known for its flexibility in generating accurate and stable timing pulses
The circuit is elegantly simple yet profoundly effective, making it an ideal project for both beginners and seasoned electronics enthusiasts. The 555 timer is configured in astable mode,
where it generates a continuous square wave output. This pulsating signal serves as the driving force behind the LED heartbeat, dictating the on-off cycle that mimics the rhythmic pattern of a human heartbeat.

Materials Needed:

120K Resistor x2\
10K Resistor x2\
100u Capacitor x1\
10u Capacitor x1\
1N4007 Diode x1\
BD136 Transistor x1\
NE555 Timer x1\
Red LEDs x14 (depends on you)\
5v Power Source\

Surprisingly, you can change up the heartbeat LED effect by tweaking some component values in the circuit. 
By playing around with the resistors and capacitors in the 555 timer setup, you get the power to control how fast the LEDs pulse.
